This document lists out the rules for MAXIMM Version 1:
    R1: Render/film in VR180 only. Rendering in VR360 would be disorienting for the viewer, especially if your short/film contains a lot of cuts (predominantly
    in action sequences)
    R2: A render/filming resolution of 2048x2048 is the bare minimum. This was determined via experimentation to be the minumum resolution below which the frame
    would be mushy and unreadable (1920x1920 is thex extreme minimum, as specified by the minumal requirements for video by Meta).
    R3: Stereoscopic/Monoscopic, it's your choice.
    R4: Surround sound is a must. A 5.1 mix is the bare minimum (immersion is defined by spatial audio). A 3D Spatial Audio setup is recommended. Use Dolby 
    Atmos if available.
    R5: Color grading is a must. Use a HDR workflow if your monitor supports it.

One thing to be kept in mind is that these rules aren't ad-hoc but found to be optimal for immersive experiences, which define the MAXIMM format. Complying by 
these rules means your film/short is made for the MAXIMM format.
At present, there is no Digital Media Remastering process for MAXIMM (unlike IMAX/4DX/ICE, anything) because of the way MAXIMM footage is fundamentally different
from traditional 16:9 or CinemaScope. MAXIMM requires a panoramic view to even map to the sphere correctly, and there is no known method by which one can squish
footage in a way that respects MAXIMM standards. So it is.
I hope the community could come up with ideas on making this process feasible, so that even feature-length commercial cinema becomes plausible and not 
laughingstock in this format.
Wishing you a productive film/shory production in the most immersive conceptualized format to date, MAXIMM!
